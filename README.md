**API Data Integration & Mock Server Testing Project **

Author: Chidinma UKANDU
Tools Used: Postman, JSONPlaceholder, Mock Server, JSON Formatter

📖 Overview
This project is a hands-on learning journey into APIs—how they work, how to test them, and how to simulate API responses using a mock server.

**Part 1: JSONPlaceholder API Testing** 🛠️

Practicing API requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE using JSONPlaceholder (a free test API).
Learning how data flows between applications when making API calls.
Aggregating data to analyze how many posts belong to each user.

**Part 2: Mock Server Simulation** ⚙️

Creating a mock API server in Postman to simulate a shipment tracking system.
Defining fake shipment data with details like shipment ID, origin, destination, and GPS coordinates.
Testing the mock API to fetch shipments, filter data, and update shipment status.
This project showcases my passion for APIs, my ability to test, debug, and integrate APIs, and my commitment to learning data integration skills.

🛠️ **Technologies & Tools Used**
Postman – API testing tool for sending requests and analyzing responses.
JSONPlaceholder – A free online REST API for testing and practicing API calls.
Postman Mock Server – A tool for simulating API responses without needing a real backend.
JSON Formatter – Used to validate and format API response data.

🔥 **Key Features**
✅ 1. Working with a Real API (JSONPlaceholder)
Fetched data from a real API using GET requests.
Created new posts using POST.
Updated existing data using PUT and PATCH.
Deleted records using DELETE.
Counted how many posts belong to each user using a simple script in Postman.

✅** 2. Creating & Testing a Mock API Server**
Set up a mock API server in Postman to mimic a shipment tracking system.
Designed sample shipment data including shipment ID, location, and status (e.g., "In Transit").
Made API calls to retrieve shipments, filter results, and update shipment status dynamically.
Tested how APIs behave without needing a real backend.

🏗️ How to Use This Project
Step 1️⃣: Import the Collection into Postman
Download the Postman collection file from this repository.
Open Postman and import the file.

Step 2️⃣: Test JSONPlaceholder API
Open the "API Practice Project" collection.
Run requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to interact with the API.
Check responses in Postman’s console to see how data is retrieved, modified, or deleted.

Step 3️⃣: Set Up the Mock Server
In Postman, navigate to Mock Servers and create a new one.
Define endpoints to simulate shipment data.
Test the mock API by fetching shipments, filtering results, and updating status.

🚀** Lessons Learned**
How real-world APIs work and how to test them.
The importance of mock APIs when real APIs are unavailable.
How to validate and format JSON data for cleaner API responses.
How to aggregate API data (e.g., counting user posts dynamically).
Debugging API errors using Postman’s console.

💡 Future Improvements
Add authentication & security (API keys, OAuth).
Implement pagination & filtering to handle large datasets.
Explore more advanced API automation in Postman.
